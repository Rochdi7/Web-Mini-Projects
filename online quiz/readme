# 1. 🌟 Introduction:
# =============================================
# Welcome to the Online Quiz Application! 🎉
# This project is a simple web-based quiz game,
# designed to test users' knowledge on various 
# topics. Built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS,
# it offers an easy-to-use interface where users
# can answer multiple-choice questions while
# tracking their progress and time. 
# ---------------------------------------------

# 2. ⚙️ Setup:
# =============================================
# To get started, make sure you have the following:
# - 🌐 A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
# - 💻 A local development environment (e.g., VSCode)
# ---------------------------------------------
# Steps to Run:
# 1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
#    ```
#    git clone https://github.com/Rochdi7/Web-Mini-Projects
#    ```
# 2. Navigate to the project folder.
# 3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
# ---------------------------------------------

# 3. 🚀 Usage:
# =============================================
# When you open the `index.html` file, the quiz will
# start automatically. You will see a series of questions
# with four possible answers. Answer each question by 
# clicking one of the buttons. Use the "Next" button to
# proceed to the next question. At the end, you'll see
# your total score. 🔢
# ---------------------------------------------

# 4. 🔍 Code Breakdown:
# =============================================
# 4.1 📋 Declaration of Questions Array:        
# ---------------------------------------------
# The questions are stored in an array called `questions`,
# where each object represents a quiz question and its 
# possible answers.
#
# Example:                                     
# ---------------------------------------------
# ```javascript
# const questions = [                          
#   { question: "What is the capital of France?",
#     answers: [                               
#       {text: "Lille", correct: false},      
#       {text: "Paris", correct: true},       
#       {text: "Marseille", correct: false},  
#     ]                                        
#   }
# ];
# ```
# ---------------------------------------------

# 4.2 🛠️ Variables and Constants:
# ---------------------------------------------
# Several elements are captured from the DOM, such as:
# - `questionElement`: Displays the current question.
# - `answersButtons`: Holds the answer buttons.
# - `timerElement`: Displays elapsed time. ⏳
# ---------------------------------------------

# 4.3 ⚙️ Function Declarations:
# ---------------------------------------------
# - `startTimer()`: Starts a timer for the quiz to track 
#   time elapsed during the game.
# - `showQuestion()`: Displays the current question and 
#   possible answers to the user.
# - `selectAnswer()`: Handles the logic when a user selects
#   an answer, including determining if it's correct and 
#   updating the UI accordingly.
# - `totheNextQuestion()`: Moves to the next question when
#   the "Next" button is clicked.
# - `showScore()`: Displays the final score at the end of 
#   the quiz. 🎉
# ---------------------------------------------

# 4.4 🎨 Styling and User Experience:
