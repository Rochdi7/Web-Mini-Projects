## Overview

The **Clock Stop Watch** is a simple web application that allows users to start, stop, and reset a stopwatch, displaying the elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a visually appealing user interface.

## Features

- **Start**: Start measuring the time.
- **Stop**: Pause the stopwatch while keeping the current elapsed time.
- **Reset**: Reset the elapsed time to zero.

The clock face is presented using SVG elements to provide a clean and stylish representation.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling for the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality to control the stopwatch.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the main HTML structure of the project.
- **style.css**: Defines the visual presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
- **script.js**: Provides the JavaScript functions for stopwatch operations (start, stop, reset).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rochdi7/Web-Mini-Projects
   \`\`\`

2. Open the \`index.html\` file in your browser:

   \`\`\`bash
   open index.html
   \`\`\`

3. Interact with the buttons to start, stop, or reset the stopwatch.

## Styling Details

- **Background**: Light grey to provide a subtle and neutral backdrop.
- **Buttons**: Green (Start), Red (Reset), and Navy Blue (Stop) buttons to clearly differentiate actions.
- **Clock Display**: Centered with a circular SVG to give a classic stopwatch appearance.

## How It Works

The JavaScript code tracks elapsed time using the \`Date.now()\` method and updates the display in real time using an interval. When the **Start** button is pressed, the timer begins to count. The **Stop** button pauses the timer, and the **Reset** button sets it back to zero.
